The folder contains the raw csv file called `Netflix_shows_movies.csv`
The folder also contains two jupyter worksheets namely, `python-code.ipynb` and `Rcode.ipynb`.

- `python-code.ipynb` contains python code
The code imports both pandas and matplotlib libraries which were both used for data visualization

- `Rcode.ipynb` contains R code.
The code imports ggplot2 and readr for fetching the csv file and then visualizing the data.
